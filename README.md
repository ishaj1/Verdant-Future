# Verdant Future

## Description

Verdant Future is an online platform built for business and environmental projects to encourage environmental sustainability.

Companies and projects can register to join the platform.

Projects can receive funding from any companies that donate money to them.

Companies can get evaluated to access their sustainability and will receive "green credits" that are an indication of how environmentally friendly they are.
In addition to donating to projects to gain green credits, companies can also engage in trading with other companies. A company can offer to purchase some number of credits from another company, who can accept or decline the offer.
