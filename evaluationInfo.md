# Understanding Evaluation in Verdant Future

Evaluation of the company's environmental impact is conducted across four categories: greenhouse gas emissions intensity, energy use intensity, water use efficiency, and waste diversion rate. The value within each category will be compared with recommended target values derived from the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and goals set by other environmental authorities, such as the EPA. Further details are provided below.

## Greenhouse Gas Emissions Intensity

Greenhouse gas emissions intensity is a critical metric in assessing environmental impact, especially in light of global efforts like the United Nations Climate Change initiatives, notably the Paris Agreement of 2015. The [Paris Agreement ](https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement)sets a clear target: to limit global warming to 1.5°C, greenhouse gas emissions must peak before 2025 and **decline by 43%** by 2030. According to a report by the [Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)](https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-global-greenhouse-gas-emissions#:~:text=In%202015%2C%20estimated%20worldwide%20emissions,see%20Figures%201%20and%202) in 2015, worldwide emissions from human activities amounted to nearly **47 billion metric tons** of greenhouse gases, showing a 43 percent increase since 1990. With a [global population of 7.3 billion](https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/publications/world-population-prospects-2015-revision.html) in 2015, the per capita emissions stand at approximately 6.44 metric tons. As per the UN's Sustainable Development Goals, the target becomes clearer: **each person's emissions should ideally be reduced to 3.671 metric tons**.

## Energy Use Intensity

Energy use intensity stands as another crucial parameter in measuring environmental impact. The United Nations has outlined [Sustainable Development Goal 7.3,](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/energy/) aiming to **double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency by 2030**. Initiatives like those advocated by [Sustainable Energy for All (SEforAll)](https://www.seforall.org/goal-7-targets/energy-efficiency) emphasize the necessity for drastic action, advocating for a global reduction in primary energy intensity **from 5.6 megajoules (MJ) per USD in 2010 to 3.4 by 2030 to align with SDG 7.3 objectives**, underscoring the urgency of the matter.

## Water Use Efficiency

Water use efficiency emerges as a critical aspect of sustainable resource management. Aligned with the United Nations' [Sustainable Development Goal 6.4](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/water-and-sanitation/), the objective is: by 2030, there is a concerted effort to significantly **enhance water-use efficiency** across all sectors while ensuring the sustainable withdrawal and supply of freshwater. Additionally, the aim is to substantially reduce the number of individuals affected by water scarcity. The UN's designated indicator, [6.4.1](https://www.sdg6data.org/en/indicator/6.4.1), measures water-use efficiency as the **ratio of dollar value added to the volume of water utilized**, providing a tangible metric for progress assessment. The Europe and North America regions show average performance in comparison with others with a reported change in water-use efficiency in 2020 amounting to **50 USD per cubic meter**.

## Waste Diversion Rate

Waste diversion rate is a key metric in sustainable waste management. As of 2022, the [EPA](https://www.epa.gov/greeningepa/waste-diversion-epa)'s current rate stands at 71.6%, just below the** targeted goal of over 75% recycled material** by 2030, signaling the need for enhanced efforts in waste reduction and recycling initiatives. The waste diversion rate is a simple calculation of the weight of recycling wastes divided by the weight of total waste.

## Green Credit Determination

The Green Credit Determination process involves calculating a rating for each category (Greenhouse Gas, Energy Use, Water Use, and Waste Diversion) based on how a company's performance compares to a benchmark.
The rating for each category is calculated using a function that compares the company's performance with a benchmark value.

1. The initial rating starts at 50.
2. Performance is calculated as the company's input minus the benchmark.
3. In categories like greenhouse gas emissions and energy use, lower values than the benchmark indicate better performance. To reflect this, the performance is multiplied by -1.
4. The performance ratio is then determined by dividing the performance by the benchmark.
5. Finally, the rating is calculated by adding 50 times the performance ratio to the initial rating.
6. The rating will be between 0 and 100.

The overall green credit score is determined by combining the ratings for each category. Each category contributes equally to the final score (25% weight for each). A company is considered "green" if its total green credit score is 50 or higher.

### Sample Calculation for each category:

Company X’s Performance = company*input - benchmark
\_For greenhouse gas emissions and energy use, the performance is multiplied by -1.*
Company X’s Performance Ratio = Company X’s Performance / benchmark
Company X’s Rating = 50 + 50 \* performance ratio
